# Internships!

Please kindly consider starring this repo (top right corner) to help it grow and make revisiting it easier for you

## Use the List

1. ## like Excel on a [website](https://zacklight.com/internships/) (URL might change so make sure to star this repo)!

2. ## as a [markdown file](internships.md)!

3. ## as a [CSV file](internships.csv)!

4. ## add to Trello (use the website/CSV file and follow [this](https://youtu.be/R90LYeZSZpA))

* Support most of the basic Excel functionalities such as **filtering** (downloading and importing are yet to be tested)

* We am considering buying a domain if enough people are interested in this project (for now we will just look at the number of stars and/or pull requests for this repo)

## General

- For now, we mainly have **2020 summer tech internships**
- Helpful sites to find internships are [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs), [BuiltIn](https://builtin.com/) (has different websites for NYC, Chicago, Seattle, Boston, LA, Colorado, Austin), and [AngelList](https://angel.co/) (startups)

* <u>Difference between this and other platforms</u>
  * Not everyone has access to Handshake
  * You can download all the data from this repo as a CSV file and use Excel to keep track of them
  * The repo is community maintained and crowdsourced, offering many advantages. For instance, someone contacted me about how bad/shady one of the companies is, and the community can respond faithfully
