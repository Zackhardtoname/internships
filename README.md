# Internships!

For now, we mainly have **2020 summer tech internships**

## Use the List

1. ## like Excel on a [website](https://zacklight.com/internships/) (URL might change so make sure to star this repo)!

2. ## as a [markdown file](internships.md)!

3. ## as a [CSV file](internships.csv)!

* Support most of the basic Excel functionalities such as **filtering** (downloading and importing are yet to be tested)

* We am considering buying a domain if enough people are interested in this project (for now we will just look at the number of stars and/or pull requests for this repo)

## General
